# Raspberry Pi Camera

Let's build a digital camera out of a Raspberry Pi, the HQ Camera Module, and a touch screen.

The camera's settings are fully customizable:

- Shutter Speed with a touchscreen menu or hardware encoder
- ISO with a touchscreen menu or hardware encoder
- Shutter by tapping the touchscreen center or hardware button
- Aperture on the lens ring
- Focus Distance on the lens ring
- Focal Length by changing lenses

Here is a crude drawing of the button and encoder set up:

(My encoders have a fourth +3.3V pin. I added this as an additional red wire in the schematic.)
